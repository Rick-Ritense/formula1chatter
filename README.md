# Formula 1 Chatter

A Formula 1 prediction and discussion platform where users can make predictions about race outcomes and compete with others.

## Features

- **Race Predictions**: Make predictions for upcoming F1 races
- **Leaderboard**: Compete with other users and see rankings
- **Real-time Data**: Automatic synchronization with F1 data sources
- **User Authentication**: Secure login with Facebook OAuth
- **Mobile Responsive**: Works great on all devices

## Tech Stack

### Backend
- **Kotlin** with **Spring Boot**
- **PostgreSQL** database
- **JPA/Hibernate** for data persistence
- **Spring Security** for authentication
- **Scheduled tasks** for data synchronization

### Frontend
- **React** with **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Vite** for build tooling
- **React Router** for navigation

## API Rate Limiting Configuration

The application uses external APIs (OpenF1 and Jolpica) for F1 data. To prevent rate limiting issues, the following configuration options are available:

### OpenF1 API Configuration

Add these settings to your `application.yml` or environment variables:

```yaml
openf1:
  api:
    rate-limit:
      delay-between-drivers-ms: 500    # Delay between processing different drivers
      delay-between-calls-ms: 200      # Delay between API calls for the same driver
      max-errors-before-stop: 5        # Stop after this many errors
    startup:
      update-profile-pictures: false   # Disable profile picture updates during startup
```

### Environment Variables

- `UPDATE_PROFILE_PICTURES_ON_STARTUP`: Set to `true` to enable profile picture updates during application startup (default: `false`)

### Why These Changes?

The original implementation was making too many API calls to the OpenF1 API during startup, causing 504 Gateway Timeout errors. The improvements include:

1. **Configurable delays** between API calls to respect rate limits
2. **Optional startup updates** to prevent startup delays
3. **Better error handling** to stop when too many errors occur
4. **Increased timeouts** in RestTemplate configuration
5. **Scheduled updates** that run weekly instead of during startup
